```$("#id1").load('pathtofile')}); ```

Requirements: JQuery insallment. 

What the top snippet does is uses the .load() function provided by JQuery to load an external html file into another html file. 

.load() uses the path of the file (pathtofile) and loads in in the goal id/class html tag. 

So:
```$("#importfile").load('/test/index.html')}); ```

This code would load the `/test/index.html` file into the tag with the corresponding id of `importfile`.
